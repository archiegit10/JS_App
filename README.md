# JS_App

## Why are we doing this?
#### I have been tasked to create a HR application containing and capturing employee information. This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application giving an opportunitiy to show and implement the practices learnt during QA training. 
## How I expected the challenge to go.
#### Having had limited experience of front-end but a fair amount in javascript, I expected the project not to be too challenging though challenge me in some areas. My main goal of the project was to create an application with no bugs.
## What went well?
#### The use of github branches allowed me to revert back to a previous branch/ commit where something went wrong, from there I was able to retrace mysteps and fix the bug that I had created. The use of bootstrap and some extended css to compliment allowed me to create a visually and intuitive application easily instead of the base HTML which, though function, was not pretty.
## What didn't go as planned?
#### The dropdown menu for selecting each employee was not updating and when it was, it was adding the entire employee list added ontop of the existing list, so you had two duplicate sets of employees in the dropdown list. This was fixed however by clearing the dropdown elements before the dropdown elements were created again. Github was also a difficulty due to my existing github account being logged in (the one I don't have access too) so having to change access levels for archiegit10. 
## Possible improvements for future
#### The use of React could improve the reusability and creation of Cards where it could offer more customisation in the event of the application function expands. Using Jira to track branches and features as well, I felt that due to the small scope of the project that Jira would make things more difficult to track changes across functions where i'd implement a function somewhere else.
